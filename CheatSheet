-- General Cool Stuff --
using the "-o" option will condense output
#> ansible all -m ping -o

you can use pattern matching with regular expressions in ansible
~ : use pattern matching
. : any character
* : any number
example: list hosts ending with a 3
#> ansible ~.*3 --list-hosts

you can ignore host fingerprints by setting the environment variable
#> ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False

you can temp override existing variables using "-e"
#> ansible all -m ping -e 'ansible_port=622' 

--------------------
-- SSH Key Stuff --
- show contents of ~/.ssh/known_hosts file for a particular host
#> ssh-keygen -H -F myhost1

- copy ssh keys to remote machines without having to login to each one manually
#> ssh-copy-id user@myhost1

- copy key to multiple systems and automate it such that you don't have to connect and enter the password for each one
1. install sshpass
#> sudo apt get sshpass

2. create password.txt
#> echo mypassword > password.txt

3. create a for loop in bash.
#> for user in ansible root
 > do
 >   for os in ubuntu centos
 >   do
 >     for instance in 1 2 3
 >     do
 >       sshpass -f password.txt ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${user}@${os}${instance}
 >     done
 >   done
 > done
--------------------

- check if ansible can communicat with a specified list of hosts explicitly called out. note: the placement of the comma after the -i ... "-i," ... allows you to directly list the hosts to check rather than using a "hosts" file.
#> ansible -i,host1,host2,host3 all -m ping

--------------------
-- Ansible.cfg Files Stuff --

- check what ansible.cfg file you are using
#> ansible --version

the ansible.cfg file exists in several places with each file having precidence over the other.
- lowest priority: global default
- located at /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

- higher priority: hidden in the user prifile
- ~/.ansible.cfg

- higher priority: file in current directory
- /mydirectory/ansible.cfg

- top priority: the environment varialbe ANSIBLE_CONFIG
- #> echo $ANSIBLE_CONFIG 
- or list all variables #> env
